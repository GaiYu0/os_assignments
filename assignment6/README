Test cases for q1 and q2
  test_cases/test.sh receives an argument N. In test_cases/, there are 3 text files: p0, p1 and p2, which respectively contain 3 paragraphs of Lincoln's Gettysburg address. test_cases/test.sh copies those 3 files to files/, ensuring there are N files in /files in total. test_cases/test.sh passes the N files as arguments to q1/q1 and q2/q2, and display the result.
  The test case for q1 cannot work if N is extremely large because there is an upper bound of "open" system call.
  N could be an arbitrary integer for q2 because there is at most N_THREADS files open simultaneously.
