#####################

To compile, run "make server" and "make client".
To test the program, run
  "cd test_cases; bash server.sh"
and
  "cd test_cases; bash client.sh"
in different terminals.

server.sh creates 4 servers.
client.sh sends all possible conversion requests to the 4 servers respectively.
Only EUR, RMB and USD are supported.
Therefore, client.sh sends 3 * 3 * 4 = 36 requests in total and every server receives 3 * 3 = 9 requests.
